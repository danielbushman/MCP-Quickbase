## Accomplishments

1. Successfully restructured the project to separate v1 (reference) and v2 (new development)
2. Created comprehensive planning and documentation structure
3. Updated README to focus on Claude integration
4. Documented architectural approach for v2
5. Established task tracking system for ongoing development

## Next Steps

1. Set up TypeScript configuration and ESLint
2. Implement TypeScript directory structure
3. Configure testing infrastructure with Jest
4. Begin implementing core client functionality

## Blockers & Issues

No blockers or critical issues identified at this time.

## Notes & Observations

The decision to migrate entirely to TypeScript will provide better type safety and developer experience. Initial analysis of v1 code shows several areas for improvement in error handling and API interface design.

## Resources Needed

None additional at this time.
