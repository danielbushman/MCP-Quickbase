# Task Verification Process

This document outlines the verification process used to ensure all tasks are properly completed and verified before being marked as such in the task registry.

## Process Overview

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  Implement   │     │   Verify     │     │  Update      │
│   Changes    │────►│   Changes    │────►│   Status     │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Implementation Completion

- All code changes are committed to version control
- Code meets style guidelines and linting rules
- Basic functionality is confirmed by the implementer

### 2. Verification Checks

For each task type, specific verification methods are used:

#### Code Implementation Tasks

- Code compiles without errors
- Unit tests pass (if applicable)
- Code adheres to TypeScript standards
- Functionality matches specification
- No regressions in existing functionality

#### Documentation Tasks

- Documentation is complete and accurate
- All required sections are present
- Links are valid
- Information is up-to-date

#### Infrastructure Tasks

- Configuration is valid
- System operates as expected
- Environment works correctly

### 3. Evidence Collection

For each completed task, evidence is collected:

- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Test results
- Git commit references
- Specific verification steps taken

### 4. Status Update

Only after verification is complete:

- Task status is updated in registry
- Last update date is set to current date
- Verification evidence is noted in comments

## Verification Examples

### Example 1: Verifying Code Implementation

**Task:** Implement authentication module

**Verification Steps:**
1. Code written and committed (commit: `abc123`)
2. Module compiles without errors
3. Auth module successfully creates and validates tokens
4. Unit tests pass (test coverage: 85%)
5. Integration with API client verified

**Evidence:** Test output showing successful authentication with Quickbase API

### Example 2: Verifying Infrastructure Task

**Task:** Set up TypeScript configuration

**Verification Steps:**
1. tsconfig.json created and committed
2. Sample TypeScript file compiles correctly
3. Configuration includes all required options
4. Integration with build process verified

**Evidence:** Build output showing successful compilation of TypeScript files

## Failure Resolution

If verification fails:

1. Task remains "In Progress"
2. Issues are documented
3. Implementation is updated to address issues
4. Verification process repeats

## Continuous Validation

As development progresses, previously verified tasks may be re-validated:

- When dependent tasks are implemented
- During integration testing
- After significant architecture changes

This ensures continuous quality throughout the development lifecycle.
