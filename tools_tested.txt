## Next Steps

1. Continue testing remaining tools marked as "NEEDS TESTING" 
2. Implement retry logic for transient errors
3. Add better logging of API requests/responses
4. Add support for rate limiting and API throttling
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
6. Add comprehensive documentation with examples for each tool
7. Add more extensive error handling tests for edge cases
8. Consider adding automated testing for CI/CD pipeline
