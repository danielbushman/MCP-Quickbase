   - Changed field property names from `name` and `type` to `label` and `fieldType`

2. Field Updates:
   - Changed from POST to PUT method
   - Used proper endpoint format `/fields/{field_id}`
   - Added complete field definition in the payload
   - Preserved existing field properties when updating

3. Field Deletion:
   - Updated endpoint to use query parameter for table ID
   - Changed payload to use fieldIds array format 

4. Record Operations:
   - Improved data formatting to match QuickBase API expectations
   - Added field ID conversion from string to integer when needed
   - Better handling of the record ID field (field 3)
   - Improved where clause formatting 

5. General Improvements:
   - Consistent error handling across all operations using _handle_response
   - Added type conversion for IDs 
   - Improved exception handling in all handlers
   - Reorganized tools by category for better organization

## End-to-End Test
After fixing the issues, we performed an end-to-end test:
1. Created a new "MCP Test Table" (buy479b7i)
2. Added multiple fields to the table:
   - Task Name (text field)
   - Priority (text field)
   - Due Date (date field)
3. Created a record with data in all fields 
4. Successfully queried and confirmed the record was created
5. Updated field values in the record
6. Successfully deleted fields and records
7. Verified all operations with proper error handling

The tools now work correctly with improved error handling and API compatibility.

## Next Steps

### 1. Address API Limitations
The testing revealed several limitations in the current QuickBase API implementation:

- **Field Update Issues**: The update_field tool needs further investigation to determine if there's a working API endpoint.
- **File Upload Issues**: The file operations need proper multipart/form-data formatting.
- **User Management Limitations**: The user-related endpoints (get_user, get_current_user) return 404 errors.
- **Form & Dashboard Limitations**: The form and dashboard endpoints return 404 errors.

#### Action Items:
- Research QuickBase's official API documentation for correct endpoint formats
- Consider implementing alternative approaches for limited functionality
- Explore using QuickBase's official SDKs for better compatibility

### 2. Complete Testing
Some tools remain untested due to dependencies on other tools:
- get_user_roles and manage_users (dependent on user operations)
- download_file and delete_file (dependent on file upload)

#### Action Items:
- Create mock objects or test fixtures to enable testing of dependent tools
- Implement unit tests that don't require actual API calls

### 3. Enhance Implementation
Improve the robustness and usability of the successfully tested tools:

#### Action Items:
- Add better parameter validation
- Improve error messages and handling
- Add retry logic for transient errors
- Add pagination support for large result sets

### 4. Improve Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation for all tools and their limitations:

#### Action Items:
- Document each tool's parameters, response format, and error conditions
- Create usage examples for each category of tools
- Add troubleshooting information for tools with API limitations
- Create example workflows for common tasks

### 5. Automate Testing
Set up automated testing to ensure continued functionality:

#### Action Items:
- Create comprehensive test suite with both unit and integration tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Implement test coverage reporting

### 6. Consider Advanced Features
Once core functionality is stable, consider adding advanced features:

#### Action Items:
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement batch operations for better performance
- Add advanced querying capabilities
- Support for webhook configuration and management
