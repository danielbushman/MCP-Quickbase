# Project Management System

This directory contains specifications, plans, and progress tracking for the Quickbase MCP Connector v2 development.

## Directory Structure

- `specifications/` - Detailed specs for components and features
- `plans/` - Project plans and task breakdowns
- `progress/` - Progress reports and status updates

## Usage

This system tracks all aspects of development from planning to implementation. It serves as:

1. A central repository for design decisions
2. A source of truth for project status
3. A way to track progress over time

## Verification Process

All task status updates follow a strict verification process:
1. Changes are implemented
2. Changes are verified against requirements
3. Only then is a task marked as completed

## Components

- `project_plan.md` - Master project plan
- `task_registry.md` - Registry of all tasks with status
- `component_specs/` - Specifications for each component
- `weekly_reports/` - Weekly progress snapshots
