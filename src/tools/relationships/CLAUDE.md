## Critical: API Endpoint Path Difference

The Quickbase Relationships API uses **different pluralization** for read vs write operations:

| Operation | HTTP Method | Endpoint Path |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Get relationships | GET | `/tables/{tableId}/relationships` (plural) |
| Create relationship | POST | `/tables/{tableId}/relationship` (singular) |
| Update relationship | POST | `/tables/{tableId}/relationship/{relationshipId}` (singular) |
| Delete relationship | DELETE | `/tables/{tableId}/relationship/{relationshipId}` (singular) |

This was discovered through live API testing - the OpenAPI spec and official docs don't clearly call this out. Using the wrong form results in HTTP 404 errors.

**Reference**: Verified against [node-quickbase](https://github.com/tflanagan/node-quickbase) library which is autogenerated from the Quickbase OpenAPI spec.
