# QuickBase MCP Connector v2 Project Plan

## Project Overview

The Quickbase MCP Connector v2 is a complete rewrite of the original connector with a focus on:
- Single language (TypeScript) architecture
- Improved usability with Claude
- Better error handling and reliability
- Enhanced documentation and testing

## Major Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Project structure setup
- Architecture design
- Core infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- TypeScript conversion
- API client development
- Basic MCP tools

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Advanced caching
- Error handling improvements
- Complete tool set

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- Comprehensive test suite
- User documentation
- Developer guides

## Timeline

| Phase | Status | Estimated Completion |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | In Progress | Week 1 |
| Phase 2: Core Implementation | Not Started | Week 2-3 |
| Phase 3: Enhanced Features | Not Started | Week 4-5 |
| Phase 4: Testing & Documentation | Not Started | Week 6 |

## Success Criteria

1. All critical functionality from v1 is available in v2
2. 100% of code is TypeScript with proper typing
3. Test coverage exceeds 80%
4. Zero known bugs in final release
5. Documentation covers all use cases

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API compatibility issues | Regular testing against live Quickbase API |
| Performance degradation | Benchmark against v1 for critical operations |
| Breaking changes | Maintain compatibility with v1 tool signatures |
| Complex edge cases | Comprehensive test suite with edge case coverage |

## Measurement & Tracking

Progress will be tracked through:
1. Weekly status reports
2. Task completion registry
3. Test coverage metrics
4. Performance benchmarks

All planning documents will be updated as the project evolves.
