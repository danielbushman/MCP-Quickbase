## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include project names, employee names, or specific dates when relevant
2. **Ask for Follow-ups**: Add "and suggest next steps" or "and recommend actions" to get actionable insights
3. **Combine Requests**: You can combine multiple queries, like "Show me safety incidents AND material usage for the Commercial Building project"
4. **Request Formatting**: Specify how you want results displayed: "format as a table," "create a bulleted list," or "generate a professional report"
5. **Set Time Ranges**: Use phrases like "in the last 30 days," "this quarter," or "since January 1st" to focus on specific periods
