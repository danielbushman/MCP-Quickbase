## End-to-End Test
After fixing the issues, we performed an end-to-end test:
1. Created a new "MCP Test Table" (buy479b7i)
2. Added multiple fields to the table:
   - Task Name (text field)
   - Priority (text field)
   - Due Date (date field)
3. Created a record with data in all fields 
4. Successfully queried and confirmed the record was created
5. Updated field values in the record
6. Successfully deleted fields and records
7. Verified all operations with proper error handling

The tools now work correctly with improved error handling and API compatibility.

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing the remaining tools:
   - User and role operations (get_user, get_current_user, get_user_roles, manage_users)
   - Form and dashboard operations (manage_forms, manage_dashboards)
2. Investigate and improve file upload functionality:
   - Research QuickBase API documentation for correct multipart/form-data format
   - Consider using QuickBase's official SDK for file operations
   - Implement proper error handling for file operations
3. Add comprehensive test coverage:
   - Create separate test scripts for each API category
   - Test edge cases and error handling
4. Create automated integration tests for CI/CD:
   - Design test suite that can run in a CI environment
   - Set up automated testing with GitHub Actions or similar
5. Improve documentation:
   - Add detailed documentation for each tool
   - Create usage examples
   - Document known limitations (like update_field and file uploads)
6. Create example workflows:
   - Application and table setup
   - Data management workflows
   - User and permission management
   - Reporting and dashboard creation
